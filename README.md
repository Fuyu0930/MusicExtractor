# Music Extractor

## Introduction
This is a simple music extractor that could extract mp3 files information, generating a database and mp3 file's album cover images. The music extractor could allow users to drag music files into the program, select output directory, and get related outputs in the directory.

The output data have the following columns:
* Unique song id
* Song name
* Artist name
* Album name
* Album cover image location

Users could use these information to build their own projects.


## Usage Instruction
To use it, first use the command line `pip3 install requirements.txt` to install required packages to run the Python Script. Then use `python3 MusicExtractor.py` command to run the script.

Ideally, if the script ran successfully, a window will pop up, and users could drag their mp3 files into the window, and select corresponding database and album cover image directories.

Finally, press **Select** button to execute the files.

## Attention
This project is just a tool for users to extract mp3 file information. We will not provide any mp3 files for everyone. Please buy the original music and support your favorite artists!
